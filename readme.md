# Student poll

This student poll was made with the intent to get a better insight of student needs and expectations during their internships and employment.

The poll language is croatian.
All students tested have a minimum final grade of B, with most of them having a grade mean > 4.0, have finished at least one internship and have finished either their second or final masters year.
